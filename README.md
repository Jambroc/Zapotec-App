The Zapotec (English: /ˈzæpətɛk/)[3] languages are a group of closely related indigenous Mesoamerican languages that constitute a main branch of the Oto-Manguean language family and which is spoken by the Zapotec people from the southwestern-central highlands of Mexico. The 2010 Mexican census reports 425,000 speakers,[4] with the majority inhabiting the state of Oaxaca. Zapotec-speaking communities are also found in the neighboring states of Puebla, Veracruz, Guerrero and Baja California. Labor migration has also brought a number of native Zapotec-speakers to the United States, particularly in California and Bridgeton, New Jersey. Most Zapotec speaking communities are highly bilingual in Spanish. Reference Wikipedia
